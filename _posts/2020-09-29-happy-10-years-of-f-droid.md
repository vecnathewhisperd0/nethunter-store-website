title: Happy 10 Years of F-Droid!
---

10 years ago today, Ciaran Gultnieks posted the first blog post on
f-droid.org 1, kicking off 10 years of bringing free software to
Android. From early on, F-Droid also had a strong commitment to
privacy and marked Anti-Features to help users choose software that
most respects the users. Thanks to the many dozens of contributors
over the years, F-Droid now brings free software to millions of users,
and is built into many Android ROMs and devices.

In honor of this occasion, there are two new alpha releases:

* F-Droid (_client_) [v1.10](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/milestones/43)-alpha1
* _fdroidserver_ [v2.0](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/milestones/10)a2
