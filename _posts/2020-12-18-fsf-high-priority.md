title: "Vote now and make F-Droid a High Priority for FSF"

At the end of October 2020 the FSF Committee began the review of the High
Priority Projects free software list and they need your feedback by
January 8.

Given how the focus of this whole year ended up about human mobility and the
computers that help us do our work and play wherever we were, this will be a
great way for you to show some love to this little robot that holds a passion
for Free and Open Source software and that kept on churning updates and provide
new apps on the Android platform all year long.

You can just send them an email or better yet write a blog or a social media post
and send them that link.
