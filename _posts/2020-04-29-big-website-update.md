title: Big Website Update
author: eighthave
---

We have just completed a big overhaul of the website that makes it run
smoother, handle translations better, and it much easier to build and
customize.  The whole process was updated to run in Debian/buster
using only Debian packages, while keeping the standard Ruby methods
working. That makes it easy for non-Ruby developers to jump in and
improve this site.  There is an overhaul of the Markdown translation
workflow, so it should be a lot easier to translate the pages, docs,
and posts.  To hightlight that, the bottom right of each translatable
page will now show "Translate on Weblate", click on that to go
directly to translating.  Another big change is the new "Apps" section
which is now organized by the same categories as the Android client
app.
