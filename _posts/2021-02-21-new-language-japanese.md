Thanks to the efforts of many volunteer contributors, the F-Droid website is now available in Japanese. While the main pages and tutorials have been completed, the FAQs and app descriptions are still in progress. Those interested in adding to these translations, or improving existing translations, are encouraged to contribute via F-Droid's Weblate (<https://hosted.weblate.org/languages/ja/f-droid/>).
