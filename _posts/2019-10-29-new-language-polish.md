We are pleased to announce the launch of the completed Polish
translation on this site!  The Polish translators have covered almost
all the text that can be translated, with 100% of the client, website
strings, static pages, and tutorials available in Polish. On top of
that, 95% of the documentation, 83% of the blog posts, and 78% of the
app summaries are in Polish.  If you want to see this reach 100%,
[contribute on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/website/pl/).

This does not mean that every bit of text on the site is in Polish,
since we get the app descriptions from the app developers.  To make it
easier for translators to contribute translations to all the apps in
F-Droid, you can find the __Translation__ links for apps that have set
up a translation service.

## More languages

We would love to include all completed languages as they are ready.
Unfortunately, this site is so large that we currently do not have the
resources to generate the full website for all languages.  This site
currently generates about 43,000 pages.  The test site includes all
translations, whether incomplete or not.  It is currently 92,500
pages, and takes more than twice as long to build.

In order to support more pages, we need help optimizing Jekyll.  No
other part of F-Droid uses Ruby, so the contributors are not well
equipped to optimize our Jekyll setup.  Another more labor-intensive
option might be to port the site to Hugo.
