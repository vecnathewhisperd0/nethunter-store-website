Repomaker received a big update to make it maintainable.  It now works
with _fdroidserver_ 1.1.10 and any Django 1.11.x version, and is
almost done being [ported to Django
2.x](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/-/merge_requests/218).  The
_flatpak_ package has been updated, and now also works on Raspberry Pi (or
any ARM).

The easiest way to try Repomaker is the [Flatpak
package](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/#flatpak).  The
[_docker-compose_](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/-/tree/master/docker#docker-compose-deployment)
setup provides a quick trial for running Repomaker as a web service.

Repomaker still
[needs](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/repomaker/-/issues/234) a lead
developer, looking for a project to take on?  Come find us in the
[forum](https://forum.f-droid.org) or [chat
rooms](https://f-droid.org/about/#contact).
