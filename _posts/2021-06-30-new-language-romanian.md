The F-Droid website is now available in Romanian too, thanks to the efforts of the few volunteer contributors. While the main pages have been completed, the Docs and app descriptions are still in progress. Those interested in lending a hand for their completion or for improving existing translations, are encouraged to contribute via F-Droid's Weblate (<https://hosted.weblate.org/languages/ro/f-droid/>).
