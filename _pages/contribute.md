### Report Problems

If you experience problems with the site or client software, you can report them
in the issue tracker (see below), or discuss them in the [forums](https://forums.kali.org/).

For reporting issues, choose an appropriate tracker from the following:

* [NetHunter Store client app](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/apps/kali-nethunter-store-client/issues)
* [NetHunter Store repository data](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/store/nethunter-store-data/issues)

### Submit Applications

If you see an application missing from the repository (after reading the
[inclusion policy](../docs/Inclusion_Policy)), please feel free to submit it via
the dedicated [Requests For Packaging](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/store/rfp/issues)
issue tracker.

If you have the technical skills required, you can also put together the
relevant metadata and
[submit that via the NetHunter Store Data repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/store/nethunter-store-data/issues),
which will drastically speed up the inclusion of the application.

The same applies for helping to build newer versions of applications.

Further information can be obtained in the [forums](https://forums.kali.org/).
